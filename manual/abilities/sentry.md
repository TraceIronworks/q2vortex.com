Ability: Sentry
===============

Sentry is an [Engineer](../classes/engineer.md) buildable which places a sentry gun down in front of the user.
The sentry gun automatically tracks targets and fires bullets and rockets at them.

The sentry gun has three tiers. When a sentry is placed, it starts at tier 1. It costs 25 power cubes to upgrade a sentry's tier, which may be done by simply touching it.

Each tier increases the gun damage by 20%.
