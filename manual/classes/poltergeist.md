Class: Poltergeist
======

The Poltergeist is a class focused on abilities that allow you to transform
into different types of enemies. Due to the variation in how each of these
enemies play, the Poltergeist can just as easily be offensive as defensive.

### General Attributes

Due to poltergeist being a morphing class, this table
likely does not accurately reflect the stat increases
you will see ingame. This will depend on what morphs
you use.

| Stat                          |       |
| -------------                 | ---   |
| Max HP at lvl 0               | 125   |
| Max HP per lvl                | 5     |
| Max armor at lvl 0            | 50    |
| Max armor per lvl             | 0     |
| Max powercubes at lvl 0       | 200   |
| Max powercubes per lvl        | 10    |

### Abilities

At level 0, the Poltergeist starts out with 1 point in all class abilities
except for [Monster Summon](../abilities/monster_summon.md),
which has 0, and [Ghost](../abilities/ghost.md), which has 99.
Note that Ghost applies to Poltergeists differently than other
classes - Ghost only exists to protect you while you are
not yet morphed.
